            <h3>Short Info:</h3>
            <p> Falco, was an Austrian singer and musician. He had several international hits, including "Der Kommissar" (1981), "Rock Me Amadeus","Vienna Calling", "Jeanny", "The Sound of Musik", "Coming Home (Jeanny Part II, One Year Later)", and posthumously "Out of the Dark".<br>
                "Rock Me Amadeus" reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts in 1986, making Falco the only artist in history to score a number-one hit with a German language song in the United States. According to his estate, he has sold 20 million albums and 40 million singles, which makes him the best-selling Austrian singer of all time.<br>
                Also notable was his very early creation of a successful non-English language rap music song ("Der Kommissar"), recorded in December 1981.</p>
